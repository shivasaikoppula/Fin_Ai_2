# Finance AI Platform

## Overview

Finance AI is a privacy-first personal finance management platform that provides intelligent transaction analysis, fraud detection using Google Gemini Vision API, financial health scoring, budget planning, goal tracking, and **LLM-powered dataset-based fraud pattern analysis**. The application combines rule-based algorithms with AI-powered features to help users understand and optimize their financial health.

The platform supports multiple transaction input methods (CSV uploads, manual entry, receipt scanning), automatically categorizes expenses, detects potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time, and provides actionable recommendations for budgeting, tax optimization, and savings goals.

## Latest Update (Nov 29, 2025)

### Real-Time Updates for Tax Optimizer & Financial Health 🚀
- **Query Cache Fixed**: Changed `staleTime` from `Infinity` to `0` in queryClient configuration
- **Automatic Refetch**: Queries now refetch when invalidated, enabling real-time calculations
- **Tax Optimizer Updates**: When you add transactions, create/delete budgets, the Tax Optimizer recalculates instantly
- **Financial Health Refresh**: Dashboard health score updates automatically on any transaction or budget change
- **Reactive State**: All metrics (spending, deductions, tax savings, health score) react in real-time to user actions
- **Cache Strategy**: 5-minute garbage collection (`gcTime`) balances performance with freshness

### Real-Time Fraud Notifications
- **Auto-Triggered Alerts**: Fraud notifications appear immediately when fraudulent transactions are detected
- **Notification Bell**: Shows count of fraud alerts in navbar
- **Alert Details**: Merchant name, amount, fraud reason, and timestamp
- **Manual Clearing**: Users can clear all notifications with one click
- **Integration**: Works with all transaction input methods (manual, screenshot, CSV)

### Budget & Goal Deletion with History Preservation
- **Delete Buttons**: Trash icon on each Budget and Goal card for easy removal
- **Soft-Delete Implementation**: Deleted items marked with `status='deleted'` instead of hard-deleted
- **Automatic Removal**: Deleted budgets/goals automatically disappear from Dashboard and active sections
- **Historical Tracking**: "Budget History (Deleted)" and "Goal History (Deleted)" sections at bottom preserve all calculation data
- **Status Fields**: 
  - Budgets: Added `status` (active/deleted) and `deletedAt` timestamp fields
  - Goals: Already had `status` field, now supports 'deleted' status
- **Soft-Delete Mutations**: Both MemStorage and PostgreSQL storage use status updates instead of hard deletes

### LLM-Powered Fraud Detection with Automatic Dataset Training
- **Automatic Initialization**: IEEE Fraud Detection dataset loads on server startup via `dataset-initialization.ts`
- **Pre-Trained Patterns**: 15+ real fraud patterns automatically extracted and cached
- **No Manual Uploads**: Dataset Training tab removed - LLM analysis now uses pre-trained patterns automatically
- **Dataset Patterns in Fraud Analysis**: Real fraud patterns from IEEE dataset integrated into LLM analysis
- **High-Risk Merchants**: Identified from dataset with >5% fraud rate threshold

### System Architecture Completed
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Quick overview with key metrics
- ✅ **Insights**: Spending analytics, fraud analysis, dataset training
- ✅ **Transactions**: All transaction types with fraud flags
- ✅ **Budgets & Goals**: User-initiated creation with modals
